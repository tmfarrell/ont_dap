Oxford Nanopore Technologies Data Analysis Pipeline

What is it?
-----------
The Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP) is a
collection of simple scripts that (a) facilitates the installation and
configuration of tools for analyzing data generated by ONT; and (b) streamlines
the use of these tools for sequencing performance and alignment analysis.


What are its requirements?
--------------------------
	Mac or Linux OS
	pip
	R >= 3.0.0
	Python >= 2.7, < 3.0

Here are some references for installing the software requirements:
	pip: 	https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html
	R: 		https://www.r-project.org/
	Python:	https://www.python.org/downloads/

The dependencies that will automatically be installed (if they are not already):
	h5py >= 2.0.0
	rpy2 >= 2.4.2
	watchdog >= 0.8.3


How do I set it up?
-------------------
Installation of ONT DAP via terminal:

	$ git clone https://www.github.com/tmfarrell/ont_dap.git
	$ cd ont_dap
	$ source setup.sh


How can I use it?
-----------------
There are three main functionalities of ONT DAP (once it is setup).

(1) Sequencing performance analysis:

	$ ont_dap analyze_seq_exp fast5/

	which gives:
		./ont_exp1/
			ont_exp1.fastq
			stats/
				ont_exp1_qualdist.txt
				ont_exp1_seqstats.txt
			plots/
				ont_exp1_readlen_hist.png
				ont_exp1_yield.png
	where 'ont_exp1' is the name of the run given to MinKNOW during
	the ONT sequencing experiment.


(2) Event analysis:

	$ ont_dap analyze_seq_events fast5/

	which gives:
		./ont_exp1
			stats/
				ont_exp1_eventstats.txt
			plots/
				#think of event plots to include

(3) Alignment and alignment analysis:

	$ ont_dap align_n_analyze ref.fasta reads.fastq

	which gives:
		./ont_exp1
			stats/
				ont_exp1_alignstats.txt
			plots/
				#scatters with various hues and configs
				#important distributions
